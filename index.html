        <h6>Posted on 14th jan in some 2018</h6>
        <h3>Food & Nutrition Overview</h3>
        <p>The effective management of food intake and nutrition are both key to good health. Smart nutrition and food choices can help prevent disease. Eating the right foods can help your body cope more successfully with an ongoing illness.<em> Understanding good nutrition and paying attention to what you eat can help you maintain or improve your health.</em></p>
        <h3>What Is Good Nutrition?</h3>
        <p>Food and nutrition are the way that we get fuel, providing energy for our bodies. We need to replace nutrients in our bodies with a new supply every day. Water is an important component of nutrition. Fats, proteins, and carbohydrates are all required. Maintaining key vitamins and minerals are also important to maintaining good health. For pregnant women and adults over 50, vitamins such as vitamin D and minerals such as calcium and iron are important to consider when choosing foods to eat, as well as possible dietary supplements.

A healthy diet includes a lot of natural foods. A sizeable portion of a healthy diet should consist of fruits and vegetables, especially ones that are red, orange, or dark green. Whole grains, such as whole wheat and brown rice, should also play a part in your diet. For adults, dairy products should be non-fat or low-fat. Protein can consist of lean meat and poultry, seafood, eggs, beans, legumes, and soy products such as tofu, as well as unsalted seeds and nuts.

Good nutrition also involves avoiding certain kinds of foods. Sodium is used heavily in processed foods and is dangerous for people with high blood pressure. The <strong>USDA</strong> advises adults to consume less than 300 milligrams (mg) per day of cholesterol (found in meat and full-fat dairy products among others). Fried food, solid fats, and trans fats found in margarine and processed foods can be harmful to heart health. Refined grains (white flour, white rice) and refined sugar (table sugar, high fructose corn syrup) are also bad for long-term health, especially in people with diabetes. Alcohol can be dangerous to health in amounts more than one serving per day for a woman and two per day for a man.

There are many high-quality, free guidelines available for healthy eating plans that give more details on portion size, total calorie consumption, what to eat more of, and what to eat less of to get healthy and stay that way.</p>
<h2 id="travel">2.Travel India</h2>
<p>From the foothills of the Himalayas to the backwaters of Kerala, the slums of Calcutta or the ashrams of Rishikesh, the ghats of Varanasi to the beaches of Goa<br> . . . India will fascinate, shock and excite... <br>

Fascinate with its myriad cultures, its penetrating smells and colours, its intensity of life, its many Gods and temples, the people, food, and religious fervor. Shock with its open sewers, poverty, noise, filth, scams, and stares. Excite with its chaotic traffic, tigers and lions, holy and un-holy men, its food, its drugs, its mountains and beaches, its jungles and deserts, and its religious and erotic temples. <br>

India is a country of extremes where you will see the whole spectacle of life played out before your eyes, uncut, uncensored, and unashamed. You will encounter death, birth, possibly rebirth, and see people washing clothes, bathing, crying, laughing, and probably squatting for a bowel movement. All in the first day. <br>

This country has a history dating back to time immortal, a religion that encompasses hundreds to thousands of Gods, and a population that will soon surpass China despite being less than half the latter’s size. It brought forth the romantic tale and architecture of the Taj Mahal, Ghandi, and the number zero, and let’s face it, the world would be a very different place if those three had never been. <br>

There is no country as diverse as India, so strap on your seat belt for the wildest travelling roller coaster experience around this incredible sub-continent. You will love it or hate it, but you’ll not forget it. <br>

India is spicy, it is dicey, and if you are not careful it will be very, very pricy. Beware of touts and scams!
</p>
<h3>Hints and Tips for India</h3>
<ul>
    <li class="tip">Everybody who has been to India will warn you about its touts and scams. Be wary, but don’t let it ruin your trip. 
</li>
    <li class="tip">If somebody tells you a hotel/restaurant/shop doesn’t exist anymore due to fire, earthquake, because it closed down, or simply vanished into thin air, don’t believe them! They may be trying to lure you to their hotel/restaurant/shop because they receive a commission. Always check for yourself, chances are it is still where it always stood. 
</li>
    <li class="tip">Indian food is mouth-wateringly delicious! To minimize the chances of getting the “Delhi Belly” go to restaurants and street stalls where lots of locals go. If there are lots of locals it means the food is probably good and cheap. Remember that most Indians are vegetarians so a smart thing to do is to be vegetarian too, even if temporarily, as it will lower the odds of getting sick.
</li>
    <li class="tip">Always haggle! If you are going to buy something, you will always be quoted ten times as much as the item is actually worth. Start with a ridiculously low counter offer, and keep smiling and laughing, but remain firm and go up very slowly. Another trick is to walk away, that will mostly get high sellers to drop the price quickly. Always remember it is more of a game, so try not to express anger or over-excitement. 
</li>
    <li class="tip">Most visitors will be stared at in India. You will be stared at on the streets, in the restaurants, in the trains, buses and planes. Sometimes people may touch your skin or hair to see if it is real. 
</li>
    <li class="tip">Women are advised to be wary of very crowded and very empty places. Rape and sexual harassment are unfortunately major problems that have hit global news more frequently in recent years.
</li>
    <li class="tip">The positives far outweigh the negatives in India. Please be aware of the negatives, but don’t let them deter you from going to this marvelous, one-of-a-kind country!

<h2 id="beauty">Beauty Care</h2>
<p>Your skin reflects your health. To take care of it, you need to build healthy habits.</p>
<h3>Stay clean</h3>
<p>Wash your face twice a day -- once in the morning and once at night before you go to bed. After you cleanse your skin, follow with a toner and moisturizer. Toners help to remove fine traces of oil, dirt, and makeup you may have missed when cleansing. Look for a moisturizer geared toward your skin type -- dry, normal, or oily. Yes, even oily skin can benefit from a moisturizer.</p>
<h3>Block the sun</h3>
<p>Over time, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun causes many changes in your skin:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="tip">Age spots</li>
    <li class="tip">Benign (noncancerous) growths like seborrheic keratosis
</li>
    <li class="tip">Color changes
</li>
    <li class="tip">Freckles</li>
    <li class="tip">Precancerous or cancerous growths like basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma
</li>
    <li class="tip">Wrinkels</li>
    
    
</ul>
